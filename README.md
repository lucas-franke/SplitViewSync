# SplitViewSync

A Chrome extension that synchronizes scrolling between two tabs when using Chrome's split tab feature (experimental).

### Using Chrome Split Tab Feature (experimental)

To use with Chrome's split tab feature (currently experimental):
1. Enable the flag: `chrome://flags/#side-by-side`
2. Or use the split view directly: right-click a tab and select "Open in split view"
3. Open your desired pages in each tab
4. Use the SplitViewSync extension to sync scrolling between them

## Usage

3. **Select tabs** from the dropdowns:
   - Choose the left tab from the first dropdown
   - Choose the right tab from the second dropdown
4. **Click "Start Sync"** to begin synchronized scrolling
5. **Click "Stop Sync"** to disable synchronization
6. **Close Menu** to minimize the popup
